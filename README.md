This project is going to my personal website aimed primarily at employers!

## Milestone 1 Feedback 
This is a great start. Your purpose, audience, and goal are sufficiently defined. Your Use Case however, is more akin to an Interaction Flow... which are the steps a user would take as they use your site. What we are looking for in a Use Case is the situation in which your Persona would need to use your site to accomplish a goal. In this case, that may be to evaluate you as a potential hire. Use Cases should be goal-driven.

Everything else here looks good, and your project is set up correctly. Nice job. There were only a couple of minor concerns with your HTML. See Edits below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Watch your indentation. Your HTML indentation appears to be off.
- You're missing the &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; tag in your HTML &lt;head&gt;

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Your Milestone 2a looks great. Your site map and content strategy are well-defined, and your interaction flow is detailed in a way which clearly highlights which features you want to focus upon. (portfolio and contact form).

The wireframes are excellent. I am a little unclear as to how you intend to structure the navigation on the mobile view. We can discuss your nav ideas during development. Your design ideas are well thought out and clearly defined - these wireframes will function as a guide as you begin coding up your layouts. Nice work. 

+1 for using the PHP `require_once();` statement, and for grand SEO ambitions :-)

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin development on your PWP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- I advise caution regarding the nav structure shown the mobile view - this may present an increased challenge. Bootstrap will be covered later this week.
