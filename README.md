This project is going to my personal website aimed primarily at employers!

## Milestone 1 Feedback 
This is a great start. Your purpose, audience, and goal are sufficiently defined. Your Use Case however, is more akin to an Interaction Flow... which are the steps a user would take as they use your site. What we are looking for in a Use Case is the situation in which your Persona would need to use your site to accomplish a goal. In this case, that may be to evaluate you as a potential hire. Use Cases should be goal-driven.

Everything else here looks good, and your project is set up correctly. Nice job. There were only a couple of minor concerns with your HTML. See Edits below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Watch your indentation. Your HTML indentation appears to be off.
- You're missing the &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; tag in your HTML &lt;head&gt;
